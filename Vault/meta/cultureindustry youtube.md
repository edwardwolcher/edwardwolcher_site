These are some ideas for a "culture industry" youtube channel that is tied into the culture industry consulting work, and gives advice on how to use video and streaming tech for artists and non profits. It's mostly obsolete now but would maybe have been worthwhile in 2020, lol. 

## basic tech tutorials
- Audio 
- Step by Step 
- Zoom to OBS
- Using Zoom Features 
- OBS 
- What platform do I choose?
- Live vs pre-recorded?
- Basic multi-camera setup
- Light and sound
- To edit or not to edit? 
- Platform breakdown (Youtube, Twitch, Facebook, etc.)
- Zoom alternatives 

## some more critical discussions

- Aesthetics of steaming (w/ drag queen, Matt A?)
- Interview w/ dance church?

- Spalding Grey
- Laurie Anderson
- Mystical aside w/ Turing, cellular automata, ai, etc.
- Limits of what is possible (zoom horror movie?)
- Preface: this is unfair, artist new deal, etc.
- Platform capitalism and IP, lawyers for the arts
