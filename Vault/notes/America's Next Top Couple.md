Hidden camera show. Couples compete as “most truly in love” as judged by a panel of relationship experts. Contestants arrive as singles and have one weekend to pair off (chaotic first episode), maybe have them vote tinder style, only keep ones who selected each other.

13 couples, eliminate one a month. Like top model but for most beautiful love. Weekly challenges based on things that test relationships: go to strip club, plan complex trip, business and pleasure, etc.
