I don’t know if I’m less capable of evil than I think or more capable of evil than most other people. 

Had the four noble truths just never occurred to anyone before Siddhartha? How is the boddhi tree significant? 

I don’t know if I would actually want to spend hours watching ISIS videos, but I think I would

You trick me into providing pleasure by asking me to comfort pain

If god is real, life/time is just god learning what it’s like to be every possible thing, a necessary consequence of his omniscience. This is equivalent to the simulation hypothesis. Thus the theological question is: is there a difference between me and what it’s like to be me. 

This is maybe related to the qualia problem and the problem of consciousness more generally. If anything feels like what it is to be like something, then god is real? 
(The difference between what it’s like to imagine something and what it’s like to be something) * every possible thing = god. 

Related theorem - god is the difference between learning something and knowing something. Between being yourself and knowing yourself.

The spectrum between feeling (dumb people) and thinking (smart people) is either the spectrum between god and the world or between the world and god (this is imagining vs knowing). We can’t know which way the spectrum goes (lying/truth telling brothers at the crossroads) but belief about that binary undergirds all ideologies. 

Wisdom is never being surprised that you’re telling the truth. Intelligence is knowing whether that’s a cliche.

Was contemplating the distinction between wisdom and intelligence in D&D a formative experience for anyone else?

Should I read these aloud as a performance piece?

Is intelligence the same as knowing when a sad thing becomes funny? Is that also the difference between imagining and knowing? Is whether the world is funny or sad the same question as whether god exists? Is this related to knowing when to speak and be silent? Is this the Tao?

Is the Tao the Ching the sound of the motor revving up on the mind’s journey to enlightenment? Or the sound of revving down on the minds return to the earth? Is this gender?

How far can gender non-binary identity take you towards breaking metaphysical binaries? 

Is this also the difference between pleasure and pain? Or is that another difference. 
Is whether the manic switching between binary thoughts will ever converge a kind of halting problem? Is that why the fact that the busy beaver series grows faster than any other series is significant?

Would a show where I read these, get here, and then do a lengthy explanation of the busy beaver series be entertaining? 

Is whether the show of your life has been entertaining or boring more important than if it’s been a comedy or tragedy? Is this tension the origin of violence? 
Are the two axes whether the novel of the world is 1) in first or third person and 2) in past or present tense? 

Is this related to the dream time? 

The one axis — whether the book of the world is fiction or non fiction. The two axes those above.

Is intelligence seeing the word axes and not thinking axes? Is wisdom thinking they’re the same? 

Is knowing whether something is a good ending the same as believing in god? God gives all souls life until they reach a good ending, but the good ending for every soul is different.

Is knowing this knowing justice? For what souls is hell the best possible ending? The fractal binary ping-pong of their lives neither converge nor escape. (The colored part of the Mandelbrot set) They are trapped in samsara no matter what. Seeing this with better precision is knowing justice. The boddhisatva believes this can not be know.
Whether than last sentence sounded like it was spoken by the hero or by the villain determines whether the reader is fascist.

Whether the previous sentence sounded like it was spoken by  by the hero or by the clown is whether the reader is communist 

Thus we see it is possible to have a red/brown alliance!

Which configuration of that matrix you assume when you hear red/brown alliance says everything about your ideology.

What does that say about people who don’t know what the fuck I’m talking about?
Another binary—metaphysical thought to ethical thought. Orthogonal to that axis: epistemological thought to aesthetic thought. 

Prime binary: whether I use present or past tense when I’m writing these, whether I’m saying them or just imagining saying them.

Knowing how to solve that problem would go so far. It might even go the whole way! Is that the question concerning technology. 

If all of this is true then being yourself is being closer to god (the journey to being yourself is that part of god that knows what it’s like to be you learning it for the first time).

If that is true then art is important, unfortunately. 

You are what you eat.

Statistical sampling approach to whether god is real: if the qualia of a random sample of moments are the same as they would be if god exists, then god is real up to (the noise threshold of our ability to understand the will of god) * (the noise threshold of our ability to know ourselves). As those abilities improve we can improve our statistical understanding of whether god is real. We argue over which direction to tune the instruments—are we trying to prove god or disprove god? The person in the exact center of that spectrum is Jesus. Every person is that person for one moment in all of time, only once. This way every person is Jesus. Whether there are infinitely many types of people is whether the world will someday end. That is why art is important.

Whether the world will someday end + whether you are in line to be Jesus are the same question. This is the ritual of baptism—simulating that (you hope) one day you will momentarily be god. That moment is the first moment you cross the threshold, arrive in heaven and see god. Getting lost in that moment is eternity (god is love, Sufi shit etc). 

Of course it might not end. You might be in hell (eg stuck in the closed binary loop, neither converging nor escaping). 

This is, annoyingly, getting close to unitarianism. Jesus and Buddha are the same. 
The difference between reform and orthodoxy is the question of whether god believes in himself. In other words: is god your author or your editor? You have much more free will when your author is first imagining you than when your editor is first thinking about you. Is this the qualia problem’s significance? Does this relate to the possibility of AI?  

If converging is opposed to escaping, what is oscillating opposed to? Is this the trinity? We can go higher, we can go lower, or we can go right here? 
Is there significance between the trinity and the three temptations? Is each aspect the renunciation of one and their union the renunciation of them all. 

Is the main question the link between how capable of evil you are to how tired you are? Will to power? 

Deciding which binary pole is correct is converging (fascism) deciding binaries are stupid is escaping (communism). Forever oscillating is liberalism/capitalism. This is proof liberalism is hell.

Your personality is what order you perceive the infinite aspects of god’s perfection in when you first see him. This is, it turns out, ineffable to your soul. Reality is the aspect of God’s Omniscience doing a sorting algorithm on itself. Morality dictates which pile you should be sorted in on this pass.  

If god is real his qualities are infinite so the sorting algorithm will never be able to return to you. In that sense omniscience is the same as omnipotence. God is conducting a perfect sorting algorithm on himself which places all things in their final position on the first go. It is time N(0), the fastest possible.

Thus if you hope your current life is not your destiny, you hope god is not infinite, not real, so the sorting algorithm will one day return. This has the flaw of: if god doesn’t exists, what mechanism is doing the sorting? Seeing this flaw means the simulation hypothesis shouldn’t be true. 

If you’re happy you hope god is real because that means happiness is your destiny! If you’re sad, the opposite.

How many people believe god is real but hope he’s not? 

The directionality of time implies things about quaila (and maybe god) because if a frozen moment in time could tell you everything there was to know about reality, time can’t have direction. Because the frozen moment would not have knowledge of the direction of time. This is narrative, and the sticky thing about qualia. This may also be related to whether emergent properties can exceed their antecedents. 

This is why many physics types say that there is no direction to time. They’ve realized what it would imply.nIs that a conspiracy theory?

Reframing an earlier point: you are the part of god that knows what it’s like to be you (loves you) learning that for the first time. Paradise is the completion of that circuit when you gaze on god for the first time and realize it’s yourself. This only happens after completing an infinite circuit contemplating your facets. 

Is writing music the same as remembering a tune no one has written yet?

Qualia are the things that there is no difference between knowing and being. Thus qualia and god are related problems. 

Every moment is a sensation in the mind of God. Structures that persist in time are thoughts in the mind of God, structures that have consciousness are thoughts with emotional content. This is related to eternal judgment, the afterlife.

Everything is happening at the same time but all things have their unique duration, which is related to their spiritual function. 

Dimensions are those things on which we are in consensus.

A play about how the monastery in the 9billion names of god came up with their theory. This is a serious idea. An abstract monastery with characters representing the various binaries that are consequential, arguing about how to cut one of them as a false binary in an attempt to construct the alphabet of the true name of god. 

Reality is like experiencing a locked door. Achieving a consensus language is the process of reducing the number of binaries needed to brute crack the lock. Politics is arguing we have the binaries low enough to brute force the door. 

Savory is the kind of sweet that even when it’s gone you’ll keep coming back to check. (Re savory/sweet binary).

Every experience is a binary. God is the brute force algorithm. This might be related to the many minds theory in quantum mechanics. Arguments about art are this idea on a micro scale. Conflicts in art, interesting conflicts, are the most likely to be true opinions about the binaries. 

Art is one possible sorting algorithm imagined from the point of view of a single bit. Another binary is what is trivial and what is meaningful in math. 

This is why “do you know the difference between right and wrong” is a good way to define crazy. 

Every lifetime is an argument over what is the most important moment. A community is an argument over what is the most important lifetime. An argument is a binary. If the most important moment in someone’s life is the moment they see a binary, it’s probably a true binary. 

An infetessimal is a binary that has been brute force checked against every element in reality. 

Addiction is believing something is ok to die for.
