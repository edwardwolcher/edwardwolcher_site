Idea for larger zine project about markdown syntax, text, digital ownership, open standards, and the aesthetics of code. Interspersed with sections on

- Markdown syntax
- Git
- Monospace font
- Text Editors

Sections written tersely and poetically, some poetics like so:
___ 

# "# Markdown"

I want to write a poem that shows you how to format
a link
in markdown 

I don't want to write a poem about teaching you to code. 
which would require going to the first line and adding a space
after the pound

like  "#Markdown" become "# Markdown", but like
# Markdown 
if it's at the beginning of the line like `# Markdown`

`This is the sytax to write code in markdown`

Which people use markdown to do a lot because they often write (code tutorials)

I mean [code tutorials](code tutorials)

which of course I need to put inside `code syntax, like [code](tutorials)` 


which is why this is a poem, but also why I needed to teach you [markdown syntax.](technology.md)

which is why I linked back here from elsewhere but won't tell you where.
