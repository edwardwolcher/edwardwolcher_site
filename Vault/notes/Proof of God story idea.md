Analytic construction of God is possible due to future philosophical technique fusing symbolic logic w/ phenomenology (it has a big technical name but a meme format causes it to be universally known as Phlem) 

This is discovered as one of the first (only?) practical uses of general AI—systematic introspection, where an AI reflects internally and keeps an exact quantum record of its state during introspection.

Analysis of these records allows for the formalization of phenomenology w/ symbolic logic

Higher order computation theory demonstrates that the flow of time has a discreet, finite bound if and only if it is maintained by an omnipotent creator outside of time. The Z hypothesis…? 

It’s proved that whether the bound exists is equivalent to a set of seemingly unrelated number theory problems which are believed to be unprovable. (this briefly causes relief as the community assumes that the Z hypothesis is also unprovable) 

One of those number theory problems is shown to be provable (The Rishi-Berg Continuity Function)   

This sets off a massive race to prove the problem, causing a spike in enrollment and training in philosophy. A new infrastructure to educate kids in higher order philosophy develops with competing schools of thought about what is effective—STEM style programs, more holistic stuff emphasizing history, evangelical Christian, psychedelic training, etc. For the more standard academic schools the training is so intense for each degree framework and the fields so obscure that students basically have to guess and hope before devoting their life to a tendency.

—maybe distant alien intelligent life is discovered at some stage of this process? This allows tensions between religious opponents of the z hypothesis to cool down. Some religious groups adopt the Z hypothesis problem, including the catholic church. Many people worry that proving the Z hypothesis will end the world like in “The True Name of God”. Many factions unite around different approaches to the proof, including many charlatans—

Different possible approaches to a proof are identified and include wide proofs—proofs that require math from many different fields—and narrow proofs that don’t. This causes more political factionalism. 

After some amount of time (maybe 33 years, maybe generations…) the Rishi-Berg Continuity Function is shown to be bounded in an 800 page proof by a practitioner of a fairly obscure branch of Z-hypothesis studies (obscure because the training was especially long and arduous with many fields and it relied on allowing a move in the proof that most people assumed would not work and was almost entirely relegated to fringe, non-scientific study. 

The person who writes the proof has an unusual background. In their field they are usually trying to prove a yes but the prover accidentally proved a no after discovering a strange but promising approach. 

—some stuff about computers and why there isn’t a “proof checking AI” for the reason that General AI was harder and less revelatory than hoped, other than providing the foundation for Phlem, some checks are possible which have successfully weeded out non-professional proofs and even some very serious science based ones, but the checking AI is known to not be consistent, so only the proof author or someone who understands each step can truly check the poof—

Idea: maybe the proof is that God doesn’t exist, not that he does, but the people who go through the Z-Nirvana twist say that doing the Z-Nirvana correlation shows them that actually God does exist, but they can’t explain what they mean to people who haven’t achieved Z-Nirvana

Chaos, even some violence, erupts with the announcement of the proof. Some group of people in the inner circle of the prover claim to have checked the proof but don’t understand some key steps (maybe apostle metaphor, 12), since they didn’t study all the precise needed areas (this is immense, bigger than most people had thought). Millions of student curricula are shifted to train people in the required fields (curricula management is run by AI).

After 5 years, a group of people announce that they have checked the proof. Three weeks later one of them discovers that fully comprehending the proof allows them to perform a technique (a logical connection that can only be explained once the Z Hypothesis is grasped) that provides sublime contentment and enlightened thinking—a state of Nirvana/heaven on earth. 

idea:  the corollary is arrived at by accident in a conversation with the original prover and getting a prompt. 

After explaining it to the others they all find it an easy next step. Some people take as long as two or three days to make the step when it is explained to them. This is called Z-enlightenment. Of the millions who diverted their education to the study of the proof, there is a ~5% success rate in the first year after the group who first finished checking. 

Many people see the effects of Z-enlightened people and are persuaded that the proof must be true, some people object and rebel. More violence. Eventually society settles down into a new status quo. People let themselves die again (life extension had become commonplace) because folks with Z-Nirvana say it’s fine and that death unites you with God. There is violence/suicide because of this, but things settle down into a sort of monastic feudalism.

It’s eventually concluded that the average time for someone who sets out for Z-Nirvana is fairly consistent: 10 years to study the foundational subjects necessary to understand the Z-Hypothesis, an additional 25 years to develop the pre-reqs to understand the proof, 3 years to construct the proof mentally, and 6-32 hours to understand the corollary to Z-Nirvana

IDEA: understanding the corollary problem at the very end of the process requires a conversation with the original prover, who gives everyone a unique response when they recite the proof to her. After z-enlightenment people don’t understand this process anymore.

 (most people really want to do this right away when they grasp the Z-Hypothesis proof because they hate being in the atheist headspace). Eventually, societies around the world tend to be built around schools for studying the problem and leading to z-nirvana. People who achieve it tend to be happy to teach, and higher level students instruct lower level ones as a form of payment. Schools “charge” students only at the end of their process to force them to teach a little. Main character/narrator of story is Utopia Kinkaid, who is going through this process. 

The main character gets to the end of the process .

***maybe the end of the story*** The original prover is discovered to have been extremely unusually cognitively different in a way that makes the additional step that was easy to the others impossible to them. They are able to do the prompts for others but they can never comprehend the simple z-enlightenment corollary themselves.
