**Test Driven Development** (early 2022)
If while counting a set, you doubt the set is finite, you introduce the concept of infinity—you invoke it by assuming it for a negative proof. Infinity must be real for this type of proof to work. 

This is analogous to Anselm. If you doubt god you admit god in to your universe. This is why atheists are also anti infinity based proofs. 

The question to Dawkins is: how much of the universe would you want to be incomprehensible to human intelligence? If the answer is little or none he is not a faithful atheist. 

Learning how to learn is about jumping from an example to seeing what other examples are “trivial consequences”. This is very hard (impossible?) to teach, and teachers must act on faith that their abstractions are sufficiently exhaustive. 

Love is analogous to the set example above. Love is saying “I’m done counting the elements of the world, I will never love one as much as I love you. Some theists believe that god is infinite, the correct ones understand it’s about seeing God and not questioning that he’s god.
