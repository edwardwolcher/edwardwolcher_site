“That is a binary” is the name of a story about a society where people have a religion that requires the members to say “that is a binary” more than fifty percent of the time. 

Whether or not you try to stay close to 50 in your life or go above and beyond and say it 75% of the time or more is a binary.

Whether you wish you said it more or less is a binary

Whether you think this story is good is a binary.

The opposite of a binary is an equivalence.

Whether or not binary and equivalence are a binary is a binary.
