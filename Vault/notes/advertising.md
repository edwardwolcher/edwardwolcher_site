In a conversation, no matter how dramatic, profound, or important our partner is, inevitably we want a turn to speak. Our raw will becomes potential energy. This is the zone of advertising. 

Attention drifts to the margin of the page, the commercial break pops in, and we grasp for ways to express ourselves. "With this product, I could...". At least that's the idea. It rarely works that well. We zone out and move on, sublimate or overpower the advertiser's nudge. 

But good advertising scares me. It joins moments when we are authentically inspired with an immediate opportunity to turn that inspiration into consumption. Precise targeting and direct sponsorship (influencer economy!) point there. Wants are manufactured on the same assembly line as their fulfillment. Perfect entropy.
