When people talk about what they think is the “best kids movie” they might mean:

The best movie (from an adult perspective) that happened to be marketed to kids 

Or

The movie they would most like a child to watch, for that child’s sake. The movie their imagined childhood self most responded to, but they now see flaws in.

This is an important binary, the part of you who imagines your past self as brave, in a continuity with your imagined adult braveness, vs. the part of yourself that imagines your past self weak and feel a retroactive desire to comfort.

This is of course related to trauma. Trauma, in the present sense, is the experience of feeling a desire to care for or comfort your imagined past self. Which is related to grief: you need to realize that the past self who needs care is a memory and that you are what you are now is a new thing, you grieve the death of your past self, of your “innocence”

Psychedelic art is healing here, because it connects your actual memories of childlike joy to your depressed present, shows you that continuity. That your present self doesn’t have to physically die to pass the grief of your past self who you so want to comfort.

What is it that has to be simplified to make something comprehensible to a child? This is a complex question, and another important binary.

This dynamic also applies to cultural history. Enjoying old art is experiencing your culture at a younger, more childhood state and liking it, linking you to those peoples ideas. This relates to cultural memory and what sort of discontinues can server the life of a culture, dividing its people.
