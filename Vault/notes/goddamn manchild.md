Is it a funny idea to do a theatre show where I badly play through Lana Del Rey songs ?

I opened this to write while listening to my odd recording and had many thoughts at once, so much that I had to pause it: 

(These will appear in the order in which I think them in the moment, not the order in which I originally thought of them)

I lost like five thoughts while writing that disclaimer, which was why I felt the need to write the disclaimer but also a shame.

I think it sort of *is* a good idea, but maybe only as a writing conceit? If I could somehow convert the stoner rambling trains of thought into a story with characters at the granular level —this next thought *feels* like this—then I would be communicating through the art.

This thought is now about an actual show. If it's not a bad idea the only way to prove that is to *do* it and do it well, which is the big danger of art. --I just jumped thoughts again but this time I'll remember what I thought and come back. The jump was to art generally, and cancelling people for art, which...

(note -- came to this part later (as in I wrote it later, this part too because I came back and thought the word later might be ambiguous, but now unfortunately the next part is unclear (Even later note, not the part that I just said, which is the problem with this whole section: one of the important binaries is the part of your mind that is remembering the last moment and the part that's deciding how to behave in the next. The show is fundamentally about binaries, actually(Even *later* note, if I keep this in it's funnier if there's a part with three parentheses so I need one more nested item))) because I noticed that the nice thing about writing as opposed to performance is you can come back to things later)

Would it be weird to do like literal cancel culture bits in it, like thinking seriously about whether and what to say as a mediocre white man and then finally saying *yes, this thought is now truly worth expressing, this art is worth putting out into the world?* It's both true and not.

OMG just realized that this idea for a performance piece would actually be a *really* good youtube video that escalates. I'm now returning to this after going back for the first time because I realized I could. And I am mostly still on board with this level which is the media/performance planning bit.

(There's a part of me that just had a thought that maybe went too far, if this is really what I'm thinking, which is that the trans-media nature of the project could start as a video, lead into text, and culminate in a performance)

Anyway! The *actually* current winning best idea (deciding what to make as an artist where you take the questions truly seriously is quite similar to politics, and may actually just be politics depending on your politics)--actually current winning best is to focus on creating a video (and maybe adjoining written piece)

My name is Edward and I'm a mediocre white man. The reason you are hearing this is because I spent the last several years trying to think of something worth saying despite that and this is it. (I see this as the last spoken line of the video)

OK -- now I'm getting to the idea (I think I like the idea of performance because it can express these ideas in a way that's pretty funny, because the jumps in logic and stuff are kind of clown tumbles for me and make me laugh) THE IDEA IS:

youtube video titled something like "lana_del_rey_covers.mp4" (jumping from the past to say that I just had to accept that word into my text editor's dictionary) which starts with me badly playing the first bit of the first song and then digressing / apologizing and then going into further more diarrhetic (the dictionary wants it to be spelled that way or doesn't know the word I mean, I mean more like a diary but I'm keeping it in because obviously it's apt) and confessional bits that express weird profound philosophical / aesthetic insights and then links to this text (god help me I just had a vision of me actually succeeding in the real art world for this project,  which is such ridiculous hubris and I know is the fucking devil fucking with me). Ultimately, it jumps to bits of my life a la the idpol memoire (which, by the fucking way was the first moment this ridiculous hacker nerd software started to make sense )
