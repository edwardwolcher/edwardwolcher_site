One of the evolutionary benefits of homosexuality is that you have people whose periods of hormonal attraction/repulsion to the opposite sex are reversed. Boys who maintain a strong emotional interest / empathy in girls between ages 4-12 or so and then donâ€™t have those memories bulldozed like other boys who slingshot into heterosexuality. 

This is a very useful trait to have in a socially evolving primate that is getting increasingly  economically complex and needed translators between the sexes.
