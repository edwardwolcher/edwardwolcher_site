Adding metadata to your music library, like publishing reviews of movies on Letterboxd or of books on Goodreads, is a form of creative expression you perform which generates a very tiny rate of profit through engagement with others, but that profit is captured entirely by the tech platform.

In previous eras, the potential profit in amateur record keeping, journaling, social conversation, or magazine letter pages were small.
