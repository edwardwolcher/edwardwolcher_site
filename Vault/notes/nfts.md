Talk about markets in abstract. Why they are powerful what they do wrong. Imagined “monad” world where a graph of every possible preference each assigned one unit results in best possible world. This is one way of arriving at god/paradise.

Digital life and property, ownership of digital products. Horse armor. All of this since second life, etc.

Interoperability, phone companies, cyber homesteading. Websites. State funded cms platform (Wordpress was getting there!) and post office box style hosting option. 

Art markets as abnegation of capitalism. Where does consumer value come from? 

Advertising model vs ownership model. Commodity fetishism. Walter Benjamin and toys (maybe one short video based on just this).

Digital labor and ubi. Consumption as labor. Only fans, must create desire for algorithm (this is the Matrix, especially most recent film), 

Good outcome? NFTs as “abstraction layer” or universal video game that acts as a new “state of nature” built on a socialist or singularitarian society. Something like academic prestige. Some people play, others do more material type shit. Gullivers travels.
