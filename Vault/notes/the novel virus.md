*Spring 2020*

Before I was a virus I became aware
That therapists prefer video calls.
There’s toxic trouble in cleaning solutions.

I knew this man through a membrane. 
Licked his spittle, said hello
To his roommate.

I wrote a note to myself:
“This year you’re going to get healthy”
I tried to pass blood tests with colors.

What do we want from the enzymes?  
Amino, mi hijo.
Write me a four letter poem.

Am I a language?
I copy out code books like a nuclear bombardier,
Like a greedy Gutenberg. 

Cutting twined hieroglyphics, 
Re-expressing myself
Ribonucleicly.
