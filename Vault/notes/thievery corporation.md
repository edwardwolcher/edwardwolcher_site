I didn’t learn Arabic 
Before writing this poem
I thought about it

I told her that I would
I think she had a boyfriend
I knew she wasn’t thriving

The thing about invasion
Though formally illegal
Is once you’re there, you’re there

In a talk about Iraqi music
The Oudist claimed that quarter tones
Convey a subtle meaning

To everyone from Baghdad
I think he was a Christian
Though that is unimportant

"Half a million thoughts"
Oh Lebanese Blonde
Were flowing through, unwelcome
