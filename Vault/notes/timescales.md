[Artistic forms](artforms.md) can be categorized by the scale of time on which they engage our attention.

Visual art, in general, is the widest. It works by stretching an experience into an object. Narratives are porous and a great painting or sculpture pulls open those gaps, allowing us to step through and experience the undigested pre-narrative truth of a moment at our own pace.

Slow narrative forms are novels, TV series, curated personalities (influencer performance), etc. They engage us over multiple sittings and rely on our capacity for broad narrative coherence and identity (this is related to their function as bourgeoise art).

Faster forms demand more immediate attention: the gestalt of mood that comes from a great short story, film, performance. We have just enough time to hold a work in its jaggedness all at once before it is flattened into compressed narrative. The feeling of a work as you experience it it is the nugget of these forms, and the emotional truth accessed here is why such works are often politically dangerous.

Raw theatre—the moments created by great performance—is narrower still. It works on a scale of pre-feeling: the intimate connection of a shared truth that precedes judgement, like a toddler who stumbles and looks to its mother for a cue on whether to cry or laugh. This is pure ping-pong, the shared experience of time passing in communion. Dance and comedy are often strongest at this level. It's here where we're most in touch with love, and consequently this work is useful for healing.

Art music operates on the narrowest field of attention. Moment-form (Stockhausen) demands that we remain in a moment of time without the reassurance of narrative. We feel the pressure of the rising wave of time without the release of the fall —the ping by itself. In a sense this is meta-feeling: a window on time that is more precise that we can comfortably experience for long. Connoisseurs develop a muscle for this form, like wine snobs or spicy food addicts, and access a rare pleasure and impossible to verbalize insight into life. 

This categorization is analogous to wavelengths of light: slow narrative work is red bleeding into the infrared, fast feeling work is blue bleeding into the ultraviolet. 

Most good work mixes these levels liberally, playing with our attention like a canvas painted in many colors. Highly formal art that is exemplary of its genre or explores the possibilities of a technique—landscape painting, social novels, cinéma vérité, improv comedy, experimental music—are like color studies. Sometimes an artist is great because they help show us new ways to see blue.

Opera, true opera (gesamtkunstwerk), attempts to engage on every level of time perception simultaneously. That is why it is often boring and very difficult to pull off.
