# process

Here is the new proposed process:

0) Every working session is a git commit.
1) Free write in Obsidian using the command-O technique during creative pushes
2) When you think it's done, conclude it with the phrase "this is a binary" or words to that effect 
3) Cull the free writes in periods of creative lull (editing)
4) Become inspired by your own work. Add/trim when it feels fun
5) If it feels like a drag, move on
6) All work must pass a final edit where the entire piece is read aloud, feels good, and doesn't inspire the need to add or subtract.
7) After final edit, add metadata tags on top and in the body  This signals that a piece is "done" and ready to be published to the blog. 
8) A similar process is applied to the blog posts for the purposes of video making by copying the post to a new folder that is in the repo but not published to the site, which is where edits are made to turn it into a script (if any), and further media research is documented, linked (with sourcing!), or created. 
9) Another related process is for code based / design based art. Turning select blog posts into special works by creating a new template for them with custom css and html manipulations, embedded p5.js sketches, etc. This is done outside Obsidian but will commit to the same repo.
10) Every working session is a commit.
