# process

Here is the new proposed process:

0) Every working session is a git commit.
1) Free write in Obsidian using the command-O technique during creative pushes.
2) If it feels done, move on.
3) Cull the free writes in periods of creative lull (editing).
4) Become inspired by your own work. Add/trim when it feels fun.
5) If it feels like a drag, move on.
6) All work must pass a final edit where the entire piece is read aloud, feels good, and doesn't inspire the need to add or subtract.
7) After final edit, add metadata. Move the piece into the blog folder.
8) For posts ready to become multimedia: make a copy of the finished post in a new folder. which is where edits are made to turn it into a script (if any), and further media research is documented, linked (with sourcing!), or created.
9) For code art: turn select blog posts into special works by creating a new template for them with custom css and html manipulations, embedded p5.js sketches, etc. This is done outside Obsidian but will commit to the same repo.
10) Every working session is a commit.
