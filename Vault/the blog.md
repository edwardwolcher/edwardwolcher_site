Crazy idea: do the whole piece in Zola pointed to the Obsidian vault. Markdown files with no metadata aren't published but are backed up and available in the git repo publicly. Add other shit like videos, custom css / html art for the poems when they're made, but the key moment of them being "finished" is when they're actually embedded in the repo, linked and published.

This is also how I should handle all previous work (music, random visual art, etc.) for my personal archive. Some of it should go on the website but it would be cool if all of it is in the repo. 

God, I could use it to fully journal too.

Followup thought: maybe eleventy in the spirit of potentially needing more custom solutions, as much as I love Zola...
